ADEJOJU TAIWO ASSIGNMENT

i styled the ecommerce website and tried to add some things more to it

1. The first thing i noticed when i run the code is that the style.css is not being loded because its not properly linked in the the html file.
2. The images are not displaying so i had to add an assets folder
3. i added some other features to the product like Loves, likes, and dislikes
4. i changed the button color
5. i made the product card rounded
6. i made it responsive
